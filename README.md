simpleMath
=====
Sometimes we just want to do simple math at the commandline without having to echo things to bc and piping it to other programs to format it. 
Sometimes, it is easier to just type simpeMath "your Formula here" and see the results

Usage Example

    sudo ./install_simpleMath.sh  <-- to install it
     simpleMath "100*8*5*42*.88" 
        147,840.00
     simpleMath "(3.14159*42)/12"
        11.00
